# ðŸ”— Bridge Nodes

## Purpose

Allow arcs to connect via shared motifs or context.

## Identification

Bridgeable situations are marked with:
- `bridgeable: true`
- `context_tags`: e.g. `["memory_fragment", "chase", "mirrormind"]`

## Linking

Matches are based on shared:
- Attribute tags
- Faction context
- Location or themes
