# Pregenerated Choose-Your-Own Adventure System Specification

## Overview

This specification defines a system for generating rich, branching choose-your-own adventure stories with thousands of pregenerated situations and choices. The system is designed to create narratively coherent, deep story graphs that far exceed what could be manually curated.

## Core Invariants

1. **Player State**: The player is always in a specific "Situation"
2. **Choice Navigation**: Situations contain multiple Choices that lead to other Situations
3. **Graph Cycles**: Cycles are permitted in the story graph
4. **Reachable Endings**: At least one leaf node (story ending) must be reachable from any path

## System Architecture

### Data Structures

#### Core Graph Elements

```typescript
interface Situation {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string // Internal narrative description
  player_perspective_description: string // Immersive player-facing content
  choices: Choice[]
  metadata: SituationMetadata
  context_fingerprint: string // Hash representing essential context
}

interface Choice {
  id: string
  text: string // Player-visible choice text
  target_situation_id: string
  requirements: StatRequirement[]
  consequences: ChoiceConsequences
  metadata: ChoiceMetadata
}

interface SituationMetadata {
  story_threads: string[] // Active narrative threads
  complexity_score: number // Branching complexity (1-10)
  generation_depth: number // Distance from story root
  quality_score: number // AI-assessed narrative quality
  context_dependencies: string[] // Required context elements
  estimated_completion_time: number // Minutes to completion
  is_ending: boolean
  ending_type?: EndingType
}
```

#### Context Management

```typescript
interface NarrativeContext {
  id: string
  world_state: WorldState
  active_story_threads: StoryThread[]
  character_relationships: CharacterRelationship[]
  recent_events: RecentEvent[]
  emotional_state: EmotionalState
  location_context: LocationContext
  temporal_context: TemporalContext
}

interface StoryThread {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  status: "active" | "dormant" | "resolved" | "abandoned"
  priority: number
  narrative_tension: number
  key_entities: string[] // NPCs, factions, locations involved
  resolution_criteria: string[]
}
```

### Graph Generation Strategy

#### Hybrid BFS/DFS Generation Approach

The system uses a **Contextualized Breadth-First Generation** strategy:

1. **Breadth-First Expansion**: Generate situations layer by layer to ensure balanced story development
2. **Context-Aware Depth**: Within each layer, use targeted depth-first exploration for high-priority story threads
3. **Quality Gates**: Each generated layer undergoes quality assessment before proceeding
4. **Cycle Detection**: Active monitoring for beneficial vs. detrimental cycles

#### Generation Phases

```typescript
enum GenerationPhase {
  SEED_CREATION = "seed_creation",
  FOUNDATION_LAYER = "foundation_layer", // First 3-5 situations
  EXPANSION_LAYER = "expansion_layer",   // Branching exploration
  CONSOLIDATION_LAYER = "consolidation_layer", // Thread convergence
  RESOLUTION_LAYER = "resolution_layer"  // Endings generation
}
```

### Context Management for Deep Graphs

#### Context Compression Strategy

To handle graphs that exceed context windows:

1. **Hierarchical Summarization**: 
   - Full detail for immediate neighbors (distance â‰¤ 2)
   - Thread summaries for distant but connected situations
   - World state deltas instead of full snapshots

2. **Context Fingerprinting**:
   - Each situation gets a hash representing its essential context
   - Similar contexts are identified and reused
   - Context evolution tracking

3. **Story Thread Tracking**:
   - Persistent narrative threads that survive context compression
   - Thread priority system for attention allocation
   - Thread lifecycle management (creation, development, resolution)

#### MCP Server Integration

```typescript
interface ContextMCPServer {
  // Store and retrieve compressed context
  storeContext(situationId: string, context: NarrativeContext): Promise<void>
  retrieveContext(situationId: string): Promise<NarrativeContext>
  
  // Thread management
  getActiveThreads(contextFingerprint: string): Promise<StoryThread[]>
  updateThread(threadId: string, updates: Partial<StoryThread>): Promise<void>
  
  // Relationship tracking
  getCharacterRelationships(characterIds: string[]): Promise<CharacterRelationship[]>
  updateRelationships(updates: CharacterRelationship[]): Promise<void>
  
  // Event history
  getRecentEvents(situationId: string, radius: number): Promise<RecentEvent[]>
  recordEvent(event: RecentEvent): Promise<void>
}
```

### Story Advancement Mechanisms

#### Quality Assurance Framework

```typescript
interface QualityMetrics {
  narrative_coherence: number // 0-1: Story logic consistency
  character_consistency: number // 0-1: Character behavior alignment
  emotional_progression: number // 0-1: Meaningful emotional arcs
  choice_meaningfulness: number // 0-1: Impact of player choices
  pacing_quality: number // 0-1: Tension and release balance
  world_consistency: number // 0-1: World rules adherence
}

interface QualityAssessor {
  assessSituation(situation: Situation, context: NarrativeContext): Promise<QualityMetrics>
  identifyQualityIssues(situation: Situation): Promise<string[]>
  suggestImprovements(situation: Situation, issues: string[]): Promise<string[]>
}
```

#### Story Thread Advancement

Each generation cycle ensures story advancement through:

1. **Thread Progression Requirements**: Every situation must advance at least one active story thread
2. **Tension Curves**: Monitoring and maintaining narrative tension across threads
3. **Character Arc Development**: Ensuring character growth and change
4. **Consequence Propagation**: Player choices create meaningful downstream effects

### Graph Generation Algorithm

#### Core Generation Loop

```python
class AdventureGraphGenerator:
    def generate_graph(self, seed: StorySeed, target_size: int) -> AdventureGraph:
        graph = AdventureGraph()
        context_manager = ContextManager()
        
        # Phase 1: Create foundation
        root_situation = self.generate_root_situation(seed)
        graph.add_situation(root_situation)
        
        generation_queue = PriorityQueue()
        generation_queue.put((0, root_situation.id, None))  # (depth, situation_id, parent_choice)
        
        while len(graph.situations) < target_size and not generation_queue.empty():
            depth, situation_id, parent_choice = generation_queue.get()
            
            # Context compression for deep situations
            if depth > MAX_CONTEXT_DEPTH:
                context = context_manager.get_compressed_context(situation_id)
            else:
                context = context_manager.get_full_context(situation_id)
            
            # Generate choices for current situation
            choices = self.generate_choices(situation_id, context)
            
            # Generate target situations for each choice
            for choice in choices:
                # Check for beneficial cycles
                if self.should_create_cycle(choice, graph):
                    target_id = self.find_cycle_target(choice, graph)
                    choice.target_situation_id = target_id
                else:
                    # Generate new situation
                    target_situation = self.generate_target_situation(choice, context)
                    
                    # Quality gate
                    if self.assess_quality(target_situation) > MIN_QUALITY_THRESHOLD:
                        graph.add_situation(target_situation)
                        choice.target_situation_id = target_situation.id
                        
                        # Add to generation queue with priority
                        priority = self.calculate_priority(target_situation, context)
                        generation_queue.put((depth + 1, target_situation.id, choice))
                    else:
                        # Retry or create ending
                        choice.target_situation_id = self.create_emergency_ending(choice, context).id
            
            graph.update_situation_choices(situation_id, choices)
            
            # Periodic quality assessment and pruning
            if len(graph.situations) % QUALITY_CHECK_INTERVAL == 0:
                self.prune_low_quality_branches(graph)
                self.ensure_ending_reachability(graph)
        
        return graph
```

#### Priority Calculation

Situations are generated with priority based on:

1. **Story Thread Urgency**: High-priority threads get more development
2. **Player Choice Impact**: Meaningful choices generate more content
3. **Narrative Balance**: Underexplored threads get higher priority
4. **Ending Accessibility**: Ensure multiple paths to conclusions

### Cycle Management

#### Beneficial Cycles

Cycles are created when they serve narrative purposes:

- **Character Development Loops**: Repeated encounters that show growth
- **Skill Mastery Arcs**: Practice scenarios with increasing difficulty
- **Relationship Evolution**: Recurring interactions that deepen bonds
- **World State Exploration**: Different approaches to similar situations

#### Cycle Detection and Control

```typescript
interface CycleAnalyzer {
  detectCycles(graph: AdventureGraph): Cycle[]
  assessCycleValue(cycle: Cycle, context: NarrativeContext): number
  preventInfiniteCycles(situation: Situation): void
  createMeaningfulCycles(thread: StoryThread): Situation[]
}
```

### Ending Generation

#### Ending Types

```typescript
enum EndingType {
  TRIUMPH = "triumph",           // Player achieves major goals
  TRAGEDY = "tragedy",          // Player faces significant loss
  BITTERSWEET = "bittersweet",  // Mixed outcomes
  TRANSFORMATION = "transformation", // Character fundamentally changed
  CLIFFHANGER = "cliffhanger",  // Sets up future adventures
  MULTIPLE_RESOLUTION = "multiple_resolution" // Several threads resolve
}
```

#### Ending Distribution Strategy

- **Natural Endings**: Generated when story threads reach logical conclusions
- **Emergency Endings**: Created when quality drops or generation stalls  
- **Satisfying Conclusions**: Each ending must resolve at least one major story thread
- **Multiple Paths**: Ensure diverse routes to different ending types
