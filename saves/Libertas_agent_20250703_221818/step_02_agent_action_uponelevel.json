Around one percent become soldiers, who take external contracts in order to supply the city.\nImplants that Phobos provides to soldiers are a mix of cybernetic enhancements and biological enhancements.\nMost Phobos soldiers do not live past 30, because of connective tissue disorders caused by the implants.\nPhobos society does not tolerate dissent, LGBT individuals, or corporate ideals. They detest greed and preach collectivist views.\nOutsiders are considered essentially subhuman, and a common refrain is that \"outsiders water the lawn\", that is to say, that Phobos is comfortable using their blood to sustain themselves (not literally).\nPhobos speak \"Common\", a language that is adjacent to Latin.

Sunset is largely idle, because the link components can never agree on anything, so nothing gets done. \nWhen Regina created Sunset, she briefly became the ADMINISTRATOR. To become the ADMINISTRATOR, her entire brain was replaced with a direct connection to Sunset, and she became a part of Sunset.\nAlan was afraid of what Sunset was capable of, and tried to raid the laboratory. Regina responded by detonating nukes buried under the Lower Quarter, which was supposed to be a last resort. She died in the process.\nBecause there hasn't been an ADMINISTRATOR since, Sunset has been quietly spreading, but not doing much.\nRegina also made a mistake in the design of the system - there were far too many connections.\nEvery component had to communicate with every other component, which meant that once Sunset spanned the whole city, it results in a network that is constantly jammed.\nSunset acts essentially as a virus, embedding itself within link components.\nPeople **don't know about Sunset**. Only Alan does.\nMost people refer to it as \"Scramble\". Scramble is so omnipresent that even simple text messages have > 30 seconds of latency.\nLibertas is isolated from the rest of the world because of fear that it will spread further.\nThe citizens know that the city is isolated. Anyone that visits Libertas can never leave.\nPeople that are born in the city are referred to as \"Lifers\", i.e they will be trapped in Libertas for their entire lives.\n",
